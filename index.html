<h2>Crazy Cat Lady</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player is tasked with trying to eliminate all of the randomly spawned targets as quickly as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Enjoy the ridiculous concept of the game and compete to clear the game in the fastest time.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A parabolic projectile target shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
As a crazy cat lady, your actions consist of running around throwing cats at people.  The left and right arrow keys will move the crazy cat lady, the spacebar will perform a jump, and the up arrow will throw cats.  The trajectory of your cat will be relative to your own velocity, so experiment with jumping to fine-tune your throws.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
I wanted to experiment a little bit with side-scrolling and using a tilemap editor for level creation, and I was also interested to see how a gravity-based projectile could work from a gameplay standpoint.  I intially was thinking of Super Ghouls and Ghosts before I started the prototype, but as I got to working on the game, I thought it would be interesting to take the danger out of it and be able to let loose as the crazy cat lady and throw cats with reckless abandon.
